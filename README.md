# Pure-RAG-no-Framework-
Building RAG Pipeline without Frame-work 

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline without relying on any external framework. The pipeline combines retrieval-based and generation-based techniques to enhance the performance of language models for tasks such as question answering, document generation, and more.

The goal of this pipeline is to efficiently combine a retriever model and a generator model to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated content by augmenting it with relevant context from a given corpus.
